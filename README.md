# Module 5 Challenge: Third-Party APIs

## Work Day Scheduler

This app functions as a scheduler, allowing a user to enter any tasks or reminders and saves that information in local storage. Time entries are color coded so the user can tell if each time slot and any associated task matches the current time, has already passed or is scheduled for the future.

## Usage
``````````
1. User can type a task into a text area.
2. Clicking the save button on the right side of an entry saves the task.
3. The delete button removes the task from the list.
3. Time slots are color coded based on their relation to the current time of the user.
    . Past time slots are faded grey and new entries are disabled.
    . Current time is highlighted in red.
    . Future time slots are highlighted in green.
4. Saved entries persist between sessions. 
5. A "Clear All" button is available near the top of the page to quickly remove all entries.
