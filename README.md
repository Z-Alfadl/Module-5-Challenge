## Work Day Scheduler

This app functions as a scheduler, allowing a user to enter any tasks or reminders and saves that information in local storage. Time entries are color coded so the user can tell if each time slot and any associated task matches the current time, has already passed or is scheduled for the future.

## Usage
``````````
1. User can type a task into any text area.
2. Clicking the save button on the right side of an entry saves the task.
3. Time slots in future are green, current time in red, and time in the past are grey.
4. Saved entries persist between sessions.
